## Tensorflow

### Things to know
- Computational Graph: This graph consists of nodes which are specifing TensorFlow operations. The backend of TensorFlow is based on highly efficient C++ Code. Instead of sending each single operation to the backend, which includes overhead for switching back to python. The computational graph is send to the backend.

- Session: The connection to the backend is called session







You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/steffenkoerner/Deep-Learning/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
