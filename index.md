## Tensorflow

### Things to know
- **Computational Graph:** <br>
This graph consists of nodes which are specifing TensorFlow operations. The backend of TensorFlow is based on highly efficient C++ Code. Instead of sending each single operation to the backend, which includes overhead for switching back to python. The computational graph is send to the backend.

- **Session:**  <br> 
The connection to the backend is called session

- **Placeholder:**  <br>
A placeholder is a value that is guaranteed to be inputted if the program is run. For example the input is inserted into the placeholder values

- **Variable:**  <br>
It is a value that is within the computational graph. It can be used and even modified by the computation. In general the model parameter are variables.







You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/steffenkoerner/Deep-Learning/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/steffenkoerner/Deep-Learning/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
